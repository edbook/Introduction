Introduction
============

What is Edbook?
---------------

Edbook consists of Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org, originally written for Python documentation) along with extensions and configurations which are suitable for 
course material in mathematics and other subjects.

The material is written in the markup language *reStructuredText* and the output can be 
a html-page (like this), pdf-file (via LaTeX, 
see for example `stae104g.pdf <https://edbook.hi.is/stae104g/stae104g.pdf>`_), 
epub e-book and slides. 


Goal
----

.. _Tilgangur:

Purpose
~~~~~~~

The main purpose is to present course material for big courses (in mathematics) with
interactive applets. 

The goal is to make students more active in lectures and help them understand 
difficult concepts there. By presenting the course material as a homepage
it is both possible to use it both in lectures and outside of them. 
Also, by using interactive applets the plan is to increase the students
part and promote active learning.

Why not slides?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Traditional lectures with slides tend to have a superficial approach, specially 
in mathematics where we work with complicated concepts which need a very precise 
approach. Also, they don't give students a big role in the lecture, they
are powerless and will possibly have troubles connecting the lecture/slides 
to other parts of the course (e.g. book, homework assignments, etc.).

Features
~~~~~~~~

The requirements when I started this where the following:

- Live homepage with a static printable version also available.
- Live applets embedded (GeoGebra, Google Maps, videos, programming, etc.). 
- Good support for math symbols.
- Viewable on computers, tablets and mobiles. 
- Index and search.
- Icelandic language support.
- Hyperlinks to sections in the material.
- Open source and availability.

Bonus
~~~~~

Can we study students behavior? What do they read and what do they **not** read?
