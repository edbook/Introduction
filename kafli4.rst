Conclusions 
===========

The survey shows that students are in general very satisfied with the Edbook course notes, specially when they are used along with the whiteboard. This is consistent with teaching evaluations where students generally  praise the Edbook system.

What about the textbook?
------------------------

* Does this make the textbook unnecessary?

* Do students stop reading the textbook?

* Is this a textbook?

Future plans
------------

* More accessible interface to edit the notes.

* Questions for students to see if the have mastered the learning outcomes.

* Study students behavior using Google Analytics.
